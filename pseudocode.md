# tictactoe is a game where two players will compete against each other. It's a board game of 9 squares arranged as 3x3 grides.
# the first player will place a marker in one square, then the other player will put his marker, and the flow goes on until a player gets three markers aligned either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. when that happens, a winner is declared and the game is reset.
# if all the squares are filled with markers and no winner, a tie is declare and the game will be reset.
# the pseudocode will go like
# - display the board
# - prompt the players to select a square
# - verify the validity of the selection
# - if the selection is invalid, prompt the user to make another selection
# - else place a marker in the square.
# - the play goes on until there is a win or draw.
# - then declare the winner or a tie.
